# Cloud Adoption Framework Project Template for non-ADO customers

This repository is a collection of CSVs and Microsoft Project files which mimic the adoption templates we have created for the Cloud Adoption Framework and housed in the [Azure DevOps generator](https://azuredevopsdemogenerator.azurewebsites.net/). 

The templates we have in the Azure DevOps Generator are simple ways to create projects in Azure DevOps. For non-ADO customers these projects can still be used by importing the CSV or Project file into the work item management tool of your choice for eg: [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) or [SmartSheet](https://www.smartsheet.com).

Each CSV has the following fields:
- ID
- Work Item Type
- Title
- Tags
- Business Value
- Description
- Priority

The Microsoft project files

Should you need additional fields in the CSV, you can create a new Azure DevOps organization, deploy the template and use Excel to create the CSV:
