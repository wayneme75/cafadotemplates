Scalability
Performance Consideration
Key Performance considerations
Service tier and number of partitions/replicas - Adding partitions and increasing your tier will both increase indexing speeds.
Index Schema - Adding fields and adding additional properties to fields (such as searchable, facetable, or filterable) both reduce indexing speeds.
Batch size - The optimal batch size varies based on your index schema and dataset.
Number of threads/workers - a single thread won't take full advantage of indexing speeds
Retry strategy - An exponential backoff retry strategy should be used to optimize indexing.
Network data transfer speeds - Data transfer speeds can be a limiting factor. Index data from within your Azure environment to increase data transfer speed
