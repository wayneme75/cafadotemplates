4673,4669,Feature,2,Business,Solution Scenario : Predictive Maintenance for Industrial IoT,,"Imagine if you could predict equipment failures before they happen, and systematically prevent them. That?s what predictive maintenance offers. It involves using data to identify warning signs of potential problems, predict when equipment needs maintenance and preemptively service that equipment before problems occur. 

Predictive modeling helps you identify conditions that indicate future equipment problems. With this information, you can adjust processes and systems to trigger preventative actions when those conditions occur. In other words, you can translate insights from the model into operational changes, which is where you see significant business value. 

Identify the target outcome
Start by figuring out the outcome you are looking to achieve ? this determines the predictive question you need to answer, and helps you measure the success of your effort.

Inventory data sources
Once you identify what you want to predict, determine whether you have the data needed to create a robust predictive model.

Capture and combine data
Now you?re ready to lay the groundwork for predictive analysis. Connect data into a consistent system and normalize it | Determine the relevant data for the problem you?re trying to solve | Identify any gaps in the data

Model, test and refine
With a defined problem and normalized data, the next step is to build a predictive model.

Use your latest data to validate the model
The true test of a predictive model is how well it predicts results in a live operational setting. Running a pilot is the recommended approach for validating a model?s performance

Integrate into operations
Once you?ve met pilot objectives and refined the model, you?re ready for broader implementation. 


Please review architecture guidance

4674,4669,Feature,2,Business,Solution Scenario : Condition Monitoring for Industrial IoT,,"Each remote monitoring project will be unique?tailored to the needs of your business and your equipment. But at its core, the principles and considerations for a remote monitoring solution are very similar.

Identify the business objective
Start by determining the business objectives of your remote monitoring project. Examples include faster response times to equipment issues, or better insight into asset performance. The more specific you can be about the outcomes you want to achieve, the better

Profile the assets involved
Map and categorize your assets?consider asset types, where they are located, whether they connect in a secure fashion, and what data they can collect.

Determine additional components required
Set up additional devices if needed to connect sensitive or legacy assets. Plan end-to-end security. Assess the integration and development work required to address your business needs.

Understand your data
Develop data profiles?including types and amounts of data your assets generate, how often new data is available, and where the data lives. Determine who needs what data, and how soon they need it for it to be valuable

Define business rules
Identify conditions that will trigger an alert, such as when data exceeds a threshold. Define the actions that should occur next?for instance, a technician is dispatched and given instructions on how to investigate the issue.

Operationalize and deliver business value
Complete solution development and implement business process changes. Scale and integrate with back-end systems and applications. Gain real-time visibility and new insights and use this information to improve operations.

When you deploy a solution accelerator, the deployment includes all the required cloud-based services along with any required application code.

The solution accelerators are starting points for your own IoT solutions. The source code for all the solution accelerators is open source and is available in GitHub. You're encouraged to download and customize the solution accelerators to meet your requirements.

You can also use the solution accelerators as learning tools before building a custom IoT solution from scratch. The solution accelerators implement proven practices for cloud based IoT solutions for you to follow.
",Yes,,
4678,4669,Feature,2,Business,Solution Scenario:  IoT Edge Analytics,,"Azure IoT Edge extends IoT Hub. Analyze device data locally instead of in the cloud to send less data to the cloud, react to events quickly, and operate offline.

Azure IoT Edge moves cloud analytics and custom business logic to devices so that your organization can focus on business insights instead of data management. Scale out your IoT solution by packaging your business logic into standard containers, then you can deploy those containers to any of your devices and monitor it all from the cloud.

The IoT solution subsystems should be built as discrete services that are independently deployable, and able to scale independently. These attributes enable greater scale, more flexibility in updating individual subsystems, and provide the flexibility to choose appropriate technology on a per subsystem basis. It is critical to have the ability to monitor individual subsystems as well as the IoT application as a whole. We recommend subsystems communicate over REST/HTTPS using JSON (as it is human readable) though binary protocols should be used for high performance needs. The architecture also supports a hybrid cloud and edge compute strategy; i.e. some data processing is expected to happen on premise. We recommend use of an orchestrator (e.g. Azure Kubernetes Services - AKS or Service Fabric) to scale individual subsystems horizontally or PaaS services (e.g. Azure App Services) that offer built-in horizontal scale capabilities

4789,4676,User Story,2,Business,Things:  IoT Analytics,,"Azure has many purpose-built analytics services in which customers build solutions that meet their needs. To gain the benefit from IoT analytics one or more of these services are often used:

Azure Stream Analytics:  a real-time analytics and complex event-processing engine that is designed to analyze and process high volumes of fast streaming data from multiple sources simultaneously. Patterns and relationships can be identified in information extracted from several input sources including devices, sensors, clickstreams, social media feeds, and applications. These patterns can be used to trigger actions and initiate workflows such as creating alerts, feeding information to a reporting tool, or storing transformed data for later use. Also, Stream Analytics is available on Azure IoT Edge runtime, enabling to process data on IoT devices.

Azure Databricks:  provides an interactive workspace that enables collaboration between data engineers, data scientists, and machine learning engineers. For a big data pipeline, the data (raw or structured) is ingested into Azure through Azure Data Factory in batches, or streamed near real-time using Apache Kafka, Event Hub, or IoT Hub.

Azure Time Series Insights:  an open and scalable end-to-end IoT analytics service featuring best-in-class user experiences and rich APIs to integrate its powerful capabilities into your existing workflow or application. You can use it to collect, process, store, query and visualize data at Internet of Things (IoT) scale--data that's highly contextualized and optimized for time series. Azure Time Series Insights is designed for ad hoc data exploration and operational analysis allowing you to uncover hidden trends, spotting anomalies, and conduct root-cause analysis. It's an open and flexible offering that meets the broad needs of industrial IoT deployments.

Azure Data Explorer:  a fast and highly scalable data exploration service for log and telemetry data. It helps you handle the many data streams emitted by modern software, so you can collect, store, and analyze data. Azure Data Explorer is ideal for analyzing large volumes of diverse data from any data source, such as websites, applications, IoT devices, and more. This data is used for diagnostics, monitoring, reporting, machine learning, and additional analytics capabilities. Azure Data Explorer makes it simple to ingest this data and enables you to do complex ad hoc queries on the data in seconds.

The original solution accelerators were written using .NET using a model-view-controller (MVC) architecture. Microsoft is updating the solution accelerators to a new microservices architecture.
",Yes,,
4794,4678,User Story,2,Business,Things:  IoT Edge Analytics,,"Azure IoT Edge lets you deploy and manage business logic on the edge in the form of modules. Azure IoT Edge modules are the smallest unit of computation managed by IoT Edge and can contain Azure services (such as Azure Stream Analytics) or your own solution-specific code. To understand how modules are developed, deployed, and maintained, consider the four conceptual elements of a module:

IoT Edge module images contain applications that take advantage of the management, security, and communication features of the IoT Edge runtime. You can develop your own module images, or export one from a supported Azure service, such as Azure Stream Analytics. The images exist in the cloud and they can be updated, changed, and deployed in different solutions. For instance, a module that uses machine learning to predict production line output exists as a separate image than a module that uses computer vision to control a drone.

Each time a module image is deployed to a device and started by the IoT Edge runtime; a new instance of that module is created. Two devices in various parts of the world could use the same module image. However, each device would have its own module instance when the module is started on the device.
