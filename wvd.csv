3549,3548,Feature,2,Architectural,Optimize Windows Virtual Desktop in Microsoft Azure,Manage,"When you move from Remote Desktop Services to Windows Virtual Desktop, you no longer have to manage basic infrastructure components like RDSH servers and gateways. Windows Virtual Desktop includes new ways to componentize compute environments, enabling you to separate the operating system layer from the user profile layer. You can then take advantage of Microsoft 365 and Microsoft Azure services for file management options at the user and file share level.There are post-deployment steps to optimize Windows Virtual Desktop:using dynamic FSLogix profiles, enabling and configuring OneDrive for Business and OneDrive Files on Demand, and synchronizing on-premises or hosted file shares with Azure using Azure File Sync.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/fslogix-containers-azure-files?WT.mc_id=devops_userstory_service_wvd-inproduct-devopsportal"

3585,3549,User Story,2,Architectural,Migrate files from local file shares into Azure storage using Azure File Sync,Manage,"If your current Remote Desktop architecture uses file shares in Windows Server to access shared files, folders, and locations, you can use Azure File Sync to synchronize your on-premises file server contents into the same file share location you created for user profile virtual disks. You can also use Azure NetApp files with local NetApp technology to migrate files and properties to Azure storage.Azure File Sync enables seamless access for files that were initially generated in Azure or on-premises - Windows Virtual Desktop session hosts can access the files from a nearby location stored in Azure. You can also map drives using SMB 3.0 protocols (as you may have already configured if you’re migrating from on-premises Remote Desktop Services infrastructure to Windows Virtual Desktop), so users don’t experience changes in their workflow.If you’re already using FSLogix in your on-premises implementation of Remote Desktop Services, you can also use Azure File Sync to migrate and synchronize your user profile virtual disks into Azure storage to use with Windows Virtual Desktop.https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/create-host-pools-user-profile?WT.mc_id=devops_userstory_service_wvd-inproduct-devopsportal"

3587,3549,User Story,2,Architectural,Separate user profiles from virtual machines with FS-Logix profiles,Manage,"You can use FSLogix profiles to separate user profiles from virtual machines, persist these profiles as user-assigned virtual disks in Azure storage, Azure NetApp Files, and Storage Spaces Direct, and then dynamically attach them to a user. Each time the user signs in to a remote resource, their profile is attached to the resource, and they're able to access all of their data.
Compared to classic roaming user profiles in Windows, separating the user profiles and data enables a seamless roaming experience for apps that rely on %localappdata% locations, like Outlook and OneDrive. It's fast and stateful - as far as users can tell, their data loads as fast as locally stored data. FSLogix profiles let you use cached mailboxes for local-like access to email and OneDrive Files on Demand.
